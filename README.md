# Memento

My personal bot.

## Things it does

### Keeping track of a friend's birthday

Basically, create a list of contacts, just name & birthday, and memento will
remind you promptly :)

To track a new contact

```
> /contacts:new John Doe: 24-02-1987
Contact saved!
```

To check the list:

```
> /contacts:list
John Doe: 24-02-1987
Jack Smith: 13-11-1998
```

To remove one:

```
> /contacts:delete John Doe
Contact deleted!
```
